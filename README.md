# _About Me, If Life Was a Game_

#### _A few things about me, in a format modeled after a Dungeons and Dragons character sheet, August 2018_

#### By _**Kimberly McConnell**_

## Description

_This is a simple form in the style of a Dungeons and Dragons character sheet, but with some adjustments to make it easier to use for a real person. The main character stats and saving throws are altered from the original format to fall more in line with skills required in a working setting. _

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone the folder onto your computer to examine the code._
* _There is nothing else required for set up._

## Known Bugs

_Currently the tree picture in the upper name plate does not scale gracefully when the page is resized. Some simple media queries will fix this (to be added in the future).__

## Technologies Used

_This About Me page was made using only HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap (CSS framework)_
